<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
This track shows the gaps in the May 2011 <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> genome assembly.
</P>
<P>
Genome assembly procedures are covered in the NCBI
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/assembly.shtml"
TARGET=_blank>assembly documentation.</A><BR>
NCBI also provides
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/237408"
TARGET="_blank">specific information about this assembly.</A>
</P>
<P>
The gaps in this track are from the information in the:
<A HREF="http://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/~hiram/hubs/Plants/araTha1/araTha1.agp"
TARGET=_blank>araTha1.agp</A> file.
The gaps marked in this track are simply the locations in the assembly
where there are unknown bases marked as <em>N</em> in the sequence.
</P>
<P>
All the gaps except one are marked as <em>bridged</em> contig gaps.
The single exception is marked as a <em>non-bridged</em> scaffold gap
at location: chr1:14750971-14803970 of size 53,000 bases.
</P>
<P>
There are 357 gaps indicated in this track.  They range in size
from 1 base to 53,000 bases, with an average size of 522 bases.
